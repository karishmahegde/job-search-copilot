# Job Search Copilot — Task Log

Replaces manually re-summarizing what happened between coding-agent
sessions. Every task, on completion, gets one row appended below, written
by the agent that did the work, as part of the task itself, before the PR
is opened, and reviewed in the PR like any other change.

**Format:** 2-3 lines per task, appended as a new row at the bottom.
`Card` = Trello card ID. `Agent` = `Claude Code` or `Codex`. `What changed`
= one specific line, not "made changes." `Contracts touched` = `None`, or
name the exact contract (DB schema, `completion()` signature,
`profile.yaml` schema, a named agent tool signature); mandatory to fill in
per `AGENTS.md`'s Rules That Always Apply. `Notes / follow-ups` = anything
the next task needs to know, or `None`. If a decision needs more room than
that, put it in the PR description and reference it here (`See PR #14`).

**Rules:** Agent-written, not human-paraphrased. Written before the PR,
part of the PR diff. Append-only: never edit or delete an earlier row; a
correction gets its own new row ("Corrects S0-03: ..."). One row per task.
"None" is a complete answer; "made some changes to the schema" is not.

**Before starting a new task:** read the last 5-10 rows below, then run
`git log --oneline <sprint-branch>..HEAD` (the branch for the current
sprint) to see the real commit sequence alongside them. If a recent row's
"Contracts touched" names something relevant to the current task, re-read
that contract's current definition before writing code against it. Don't
rely on memory of a previous session or ask a human to re-summarize; this
table and git history are the source of truth.

**Merge conflicts:** expected occasionally, since this is one shared file
with entries appended at the bottom. Keep both new rows; exact ordering of
two same-day entries doesn't matter.

See `AGENTS.md` for coding style and test requirements, and
`TASK_TEMPLATE.md` (repo root) for how a task is scoped.

| S0-01 | Claude Code | Added `config/schema.py` (Pydantic `Profile` schema for the full `profile.yaml` shape: resume, roles, locations, compensation, dream companies, referral contacts, `llm` provider pass-through, thresholds, sources, mode/partners, notifications, dashboard), `config/loader.py` (`load_profile()` returning a validated `Profile`, with `ProfileNotFoundError` / `ProfileParseError` / `ProfileValidationError` and field-naming error messages), and rewrote `config/profile.example.yaml` as a fully-commented file with valid sample values. Declared `pydantic[email]` + `pyyaml` deps, `pytest`/`ruff` dev deps, and added minimal `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` + `[tool.ruff]` config to `pyproject.toml`. | **Defines** the `profile.yaml` schema contract (`config/schema.py::Profile`). Any task consuming profile data depends on this shape. | `llm.provider`/`llm.model` are validated here (provider ∈ {anthropic, openai, ollama}) but interpreted by S0-04; extend the `LlmProvider` literal there if more providers are added. `notifications.digest_email_enabled` defaults to `false` so a minimal profile validates. `mode: shared` requires a non-empty `partners` list (FR16). Card cited `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`/`docs/TESTING.md`/`docs/task-log/` — those don't exist; followed `AGENTS.md` and logged here in `docs/LOG.md`. |
| S0-01 | Codex | Follow-up fix: added `tzdata` so IANA timezone validation works portably on Windows, and added `config/profile.yaml` to `.gitignore` so personal profile configuration is not committed. | None — the `profile.yaml` schema contract in `config/schema.py::Profile` did not change. | `uv run pytest` passed. |
| S0-02 | Codex | Added the core Supabase state tables for roles, application-status history, contacts, skill-gap findings, digests, and digest-role review state; added owner-scoped single-instance RLS with explicit policies for every operation; and added database-backed integration tests for schema creation, complete RLS coverage, anonymous denial, cross-owner isolation, and the all-roles-resolved digest invariant. | **Defines** the core database schema contract in `state/schema.sql` and the single-instance authorization contract in `state/rls_policies.sql`; every row is owned by `owner_id`, and authenticated access is limited to `auth.uid() = owner_id`. | Partner-scoped sharing remains out of scope until S0-03. Integration tests use the test-only `SUPABASE_TEST_DB_URL` when configured and otherwise skip; no runtime environment contract was changed. |
